A project of this size and scope is possible only with the involvement, engagement and support of many, many people. 

Are you interested in larger questions about how we live, how we relate to each other, and therefore, how we educate ourselves and our children? Do you agree that we need to fundamentally rethink our approach to ourselves, our relationships with others, nature, food systems, health and the need to rebuild a more sustainable education ecosystem? 

Are you willing to join hands with a group of committed, capable people woarking with these objectives?

You can become a Friend of Farmhill - this a group of people who believe the work we do at Farmhill is important and support us financially and otherwise. Many friends visit us periodically, participate in the events we conduct, and stay with us once in a while!

Here is how you can support us.

## Support Financially

### Why should you support us?

We aim to be operationally self-sufficient through contributions of active members of the Farm Hill Community. However, this is not always possible due to a few reasons.

1. We are a small community and we have not yet reached the optimum size where we can fully meet the operations costs.

2. We believe that people interested in joining the community should be able to join irrespective of their ability to contribute financially, which means we often end up with a deficit budget.

3. Farm Hill Education Trust has committed to build Subodha Learning Community, located in Bangalore, to better reach underserved populations.

4. The community is still very young. We are still incurring capital expenses for infrastructure, which cannot be met except for contributions from the larger community of friends and supporters.

Most importantly, you get to be a part of a community working for a cause!

## Engage with us

 Visit us, write to us, call us. Come stay/work with us for sometime. And any other ways you want to engage. Let’s talk to each other, walk with each other and draw strength from each other.
