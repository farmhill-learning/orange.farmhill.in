subtitle:  Invitation to join Farm Hill Learning Community as a teacher/co-learner!
---
Are you interested in larger questions about how we live and educate ourselves and our children? Would you like to live on a farm and play/learn with children?

Do you see we need to fundamentally redefine our relationship with nature, especially with our food? Are you ready to get your hands dirty on the journey to explore ideas like truly sustainable living, nature-centered learning, alternative education etc.?

If the answer is "yes," you can join us! Please read the invitation below.

Farm Hill is a neurodiverse community of children and adults, learning together in a close to nature setting. We are located near Shoolagiri, Tamil Nadu, 65 km (~ 1.5 hours of travel) from Bangalore.

We believe education should equip a person to meet life with intelligence and not stop with the mere acquisition of skills to make a living. We wish to live in harmony with ourselves, the society around us and nature. We believe each child should have the freedom to learn at her own pace. As a neurodiverse community, we are inclusive of children on the autism spectrum, ADHD, and specific learning difficulties.

The team at farm hill has people with expertise in education, neurodiversity, farming, and community building. Some of us also have degrees from places like IIM, IIT, TISS and APU!

We are a semi-residential learning space – Children reach Farm Hill on Monday morning and leave Friday evening. Teachers live on the campus. We started in 2019, and as of 2024, we work with about 20 children. For more details, please read the rest of the website.
